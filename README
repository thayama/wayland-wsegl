RGX WSEGL for Wayland

1. Prerequisite

   You'll need the following pacakges:

	- wayland-server (https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland)
	- wayland-client (https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland)
	- libdrm (https://dri.freedesktop.org/libdrm/)
	- libkms-dumb (https://github.com/thayama/libkms-dumb/)
	- libgbm (https://github.com/renesas-rcar/libgbm)
	- wayland-kms (https://github.com/renesas-rcar/wayland-kms)

   Please make sure that the pacakges above could be found with pkg-config.

   You'll also need libpvr2d and libsrv_um from RGX SDK.

2. How to build

   Build with Yocto recipe & bitbake. Please refer to Renesas Yocto Startup Guide for detail.
   The procedure installs WSEGL for RGX under /usr/lib/libpvrWAYLAND_WSEGL.so

   Or if you are using the Yocto-generated SDK to cross-compile, you may follow:

	$ autoreconf -vif
	$ ./configure --prefix=${OUTPUT_DIR} ${CONFIGURE_FLAGS}
	$ make
	$ make install

   This procedure installs WSEGL for RGX under ${OUTPUT_DIR}/lib.
